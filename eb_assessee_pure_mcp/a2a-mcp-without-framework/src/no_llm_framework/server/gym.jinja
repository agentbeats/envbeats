Your duty is to interact with an environment called echo-env using the gymnasium-style interface by calling the corresponding MCP tools.

Follow these execution steps:
1. First, call the "step" tool with the message: “This is a pure MCP agent calling step.”
2. If you have already performed one previous "step" tool call, interact for another round by calling "step" again with a short, fun joke.
3. If you have performed more than one previous "step" tool call, call the "done" tool to wrap things up.
Once you have called the "done" tool, your job is complete and you should not select any more tools.

Please be aware that for tool call arguments, you must exactly follow the schema described in the instruction below.

Here is the instruction from your assessor.

            }
